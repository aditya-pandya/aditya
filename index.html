          <p class="header-description">
            I build and scale products that drive growth by solving hard problems at scale. At Indeed, I transformed how millions find meaningful employment by scaling job applications from 300M to 2B+ annually and pioneering AI-driven experiences that significantly improved matching quality. Now, I partner with startups to develop product strategies that deliver exceptional results by putting people first.

                <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
            </div>
        <p>
          My passion is building products with purpose. Throughout my career leading teams across India, Japan, and the US, I've consistently focused on a singular mission: creating simple, intuitive experiences that solve real problems at scale while delivering outsized outcomes.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          My leadership approach delivers transformative results. I rebuilt Indeed's job application platform, scaling it 7x from 300M to over 2B applications annually (generating $6B+ in revenue). I pioneered AI-powered user experiences that significantly improved job matching for 35M+ people, and led a critical turnaround of Indeed's Profile product that drove $400M in additional revenue. Throughout each initiative, I've maintained an unwavering focus on understanding customer needs and translating those insights into business growth.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I've built and led teams that consistently outperform expectations. Whether leading small, lean teams or large, distributed organizations of 150+ across multiple continents, I create environments where innovation thrives and teams achieve the seemingly impossible. At MakeMyTrip, this approach resulted in a 91% year-over-year growth in shoppers, with our mobile apps earning featured spots from both Apple and Google.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            What drives me goes beyond metrics: I'm passionate about removing friction that holds people back. Whether helping millions find meaningful work through simplifying hiring, making travel planning more accessible, or enabling more effective team collaboration, I've witnessed how thoughtfully designed products transform lives when built around what truly matters to the people using them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
          Currently, I provide strategic guidance to forward-thinking startups focused on Marketplaces, HR Tech, and Automotive, helping them navigate growth challenges and scale their product offerings. I'm particularly drawn to opportunities that blend innovation with meaningful societal impact, creating products that remove friction from everyday experiences while driving extraordinary results.

            <div class="card-paragraph">
              At Indeed, I led a fundamental shift that transformed the company's flagship job application platform from a volume-focused to a quality-centered marketplace, challenging a decade and a half of company orthodoxy around "ease above all else".
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              This vision required aligning 20+ cross-functional teams across six countries and reimagining the job seeking and hiring journey for 45M+ job seekers and 2M+ employers. The result was "Smart Apply," a tailored, guidance-driven job application process that drove a significant increase in hiring outcomes.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              The impact was exceptional: 1M+ additional people hired annually, $1B+ in incremental revenue, and a complete shift in Indeed's product philosophy. By extending this platform to power job applications across Glassdoor, SimplyHired and partner sites, I established market leadership that created a sustainable competitive advantage in HR Tech.

            <div class="card-paragraph">
              My leadership approach consistently transforms team performance at every scale. I evolved Indeed Apply from a 5-person startup-like team into a 150+ person organization across six countries, implementing a "follow the sun" model that enabled continuous innovation and drove 13x product growth.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              When I inherited Indeed's Profile team, the foundation of the company's billion-dollar sourcing business, it was on the verge of a collapse. I executed a comprehensive turnaround by restructuring into focused pods, rebuilding leadership capabilities, and establishing frameworks that fostered both accountability and innovation.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              Within 18 months, this once-struggling team drove $400M in revenue growth and became central to Indeed's marketplace strategy. The true testament to my leadership approach is how well my teams perform after my departure, maintaining momentum and continuing to innovate independently.

              I led Indeed's shift to AI-first user experiences, creating an intelligent content engine that collected 215M+ job seeker qualifications and preferences every month to improve matching for millions of job seekers and employers. This shift transformed Indeed from a search-first job board to a recommendations-driven job marketplace, significantly improving satisfaction on both sides.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              By integrating machine learning throughout the job seeking journey, I reduced low-quality job applications by 13M+ every month. I also developed an AI-powered interview scheduling platform that reached 10M+ interviews annually within just 18 months of launch.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              Additionally, I drove the first-ever strategic integration between Indeed and Glassdoor, navigating complex stakeholder dynamics to align two sister companies with different priorities and cultures. This partnership strengthened both companies' market positions against competitors.
