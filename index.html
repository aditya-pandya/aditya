            I create products that drive exceptional growth and solve meaningful problems at scale.

                <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
            </div>
        <p>
          I build products that matter. Throughout my career leading product teams across India, Japan, and the US, I've focused on one central mission: creating intuitive experiences that solve real problems at scale while driving exceptional business growth.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          My leadership journey has been defined by impact. I transformed Indeed into the world's #1 job application platform by scaling it from 300M to over 2B applications annually (generating $6B+ in revenue), pioneered AI-first user experiences that enhanced job recommendations for 35M+ job seekers, and turned around Indeed's Profile product to drive $400M in additional revenue. I've consistently focused on understanding genuine customer needs and translating those insights into experiences that drive remarkable business results.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I've built and led teams at every scale, from small, focused groups to organizations of 150+ across multiple continents. By empowering cross-functional teams and creating environments where innovation flourishes, I've helped teams achieve what once seemed impossible. At MakeMyTrip, my initiatives drove 91% year-over-year growth in shoppers, with our mobile apps featured by both Apple and Google as top apps of 2015.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            Beyond the metrics, what drives me is seeing how thoughtfully designed products can remove friction that holds people back. Whether helping millions find meaningful work through reimagined application processes, making travel planning more accessible, or enabling more effective team collaboration, I've seen how technology transforms lives when we prioritize what matters most to the people using our products.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
          I'm now advising innovative startups focused on Marketplaces, HR Tech, and Automotive, helping them navigate growth challenges and scale their product offerings. I'm particularly drawn to opportunities that combine technical innovation with meaningful societal impact, creating products that simplify everyday experiences while driving extraordinary results.

            <div class="card-paragraph">
              At Indeed, I orchestrated a strategic pivot that transformed the company's flagship job application platform from a volume-driven to a quality-focused marketplace, challenging a decade of company orthodoxy around "ease above all" to better serve both sides of the market.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              This vision required aligning 20+ cross-functional teams across six countries and reimagining the user journey for 45M+ job seekers and 2M+ employers. The result was "Smart Apply," a tailored, guidance-driven application process that drove a 9.2% increase in hiring outcomes.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              The impact was transformative: 1M+ additional people hired annually, $1B+ in incremental revenue, and a fundamental shift in Indeed's product development philosophy. By extending this platform to power applications on Glassdoor and partner sites, I established market leadership in HR tech and created a sustainable competitive advantage.

            <h3 class="card-title">Building High-Performance Organizations</h3>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              I've consistently built and scaled teams that deliver extraordinary results. I grew Indeed Apply from a 5-person team into a 150+ person cross-functional organization across six countries, instituting a "follow the sun" model that enabled 24/7 innovation and 13x product growth.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              When Indeed's Profile team, the backbone of the company's billion-dollar sourcing business, was on the verge of collapse, I led a comprehensive turnaround. I rebuilt team confidence and capabilities by restructuring into focused pods, revamping leadership, and instituting processes that fostered accountability and innovation.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              Within 18 months, this once-struggling team drove $400M in revenue growth and became central to Indeed's marketplace strategy. The true testament to my leadership approach is how well my teams perform after my departure, maintaining momentum and continuing to innovate independently.

              I pioneered Indeed's shift to AI-first user experiences, creating an intelligent content engine that analyzed 215M+ job seeker qualifications monthly to transform Indeed from a search-first job board to a recommendations-driven marketplace, significantly improving match quality.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              By integrating machine learning throughout the user journey, I reduced unqualified applications by 13M+ monthly while implementing an AI-powered interview scheduling platform that reached 10M+ interviews annually within just 18 months of launch.
            </div>
            <div class="card-paragraph">
              I also led the first strategic integration between Indeed and Glassdoor, navigating complex stakeholder dynamics to align two sister companies with different priorities. This success led to a broader partnership where Glassdoor ultimately exited the job search business entirely, strengthening both companies' market positions against competitors.
